# Static-Build-1
developed in 2021 by Gus Jacobs
Design was inspired by a youtube tutorial 
First attempt at a social media platform. The key features included an overall well designed home page with responsive features, including color and font changes and screen size changes for different platforms. Lacking data structure and linked pages it failed at its purpose, but made for a good stepping stone.
